    <p>
        Hey guys! this is my first paragraph for my new website, which is also my first website. 
      This is the second sentence in my website, i want it to appear on a new line, but it is not on a new line because i did not put a break line<br>
      However this third line will be on a new line because i did indeed put a break line.<br>
      after the sentence. If you also see here i just entered a break line<br>
      twice in random places so that is why there are random new lines starting <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and this line is way below all the other lines
    </p>
